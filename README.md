# Babb makes tough tools.

We make business tools that are geared for the working world.

Babb builds software and hardware for tradesmen and industrial clients to manage day-to-day activities and track costs, by serving individuals not administrators. Across North America there are close to 75 million people working in these professions. This population is our beachhead for a broader stragegy focused on global business services.

We are based in Hamilton, Ontario. The Mid-west United States and Southern Ontario is our home geography. We will harness its identity and history to build momentum.&#x20;

By leverging the working world's immediate demands for mobile-first software and hardware that meets their expectations, we can amplify economic activity while redefining what it means to administer and manage enterprises. Our Blue Ocean is based on the methods and mentalities of blue collar communities at the lowest levels, where jobs, staff and responsibilities quickly shift.

Workpads is the first product in our roadmap.
